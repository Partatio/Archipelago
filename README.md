A Archipelago multi-world rando mod for System Shock 2.  Currently not functional, needs lots of testing.  
After this core mod is all tested the list of items and their properties needs to be made, and the list of items and monsters on levels needs to be built.  Along with other changes that need to be made to maps.
Also needs a full APWorld and CommonClient.
