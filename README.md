A Archipelago multi-world rando mod for System Shock 2.  Created with lots of help from RoSoDude and Sarge945.  Still todo is create models for cybmodshop and APLocations, and add gravity to eggs and APLocations.
List of items and their properties needs to be made, and the list of items and monsters on levels needs to be built.  Along with other changes that need to be made to maps.
Also needs a full APWorld and CommonClient.
